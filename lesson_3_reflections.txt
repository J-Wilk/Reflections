When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When sharing work with others or wanting to access it on multiple computers or backing
up work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may be working on some code locally that you don't want to 
be public yet or is not ready to be used.
