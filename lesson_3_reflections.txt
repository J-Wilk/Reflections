When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing work with others or wanting to access it on multiple computers or backing
up work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may be working on some code locally that you don't want to 
be public yet or is not ready to be used.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
A fork is making a new github repository indentical to another persons
that you can then edit without effecting the original. Credit is also
shown.
Clones copies an identical copy of a repository.
Brancehes are splits in a ersies of commits.
