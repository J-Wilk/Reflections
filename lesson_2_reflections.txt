When you initialize a repository a git directory is created that tracks 
the commits made. At first it is empty. 

The staging area allows the user to create commits of only the files that
are sensible for that commit.

We can use the staging area to commit one logical change per commit by
only adding the files for the one logical change to the stagin area 
before commiting. 

Branches may be useful if the programmer wants to experiment with a 
feature that they are not sure if they will use or not.

Drawing a diagram greatly helps me to visualize the branch structure.

Merging two branches together combines that changes that took place in 
the two branches since the split.
