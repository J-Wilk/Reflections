I feel that by comparing two files for differences it is a lot easier
to find errors. 

By accessing the whole history of a file you can be more efficient as
it is easier to roll back to a previous working version if issues arise.

The pros for manually choosing commits are that you can do it at
sensible places. The cons are that you may forget to commit and end up
with very large commits that cover multiple areas of the program.

Users of Git are more likely to be using files that directly relate to
each other so a commit could logically effect a umber of files, whereas
in google docs this scenario of one file directly relating to another
is less likely and would complicate the matter.

git log gives a log of all commits to the repository along with the
commit id and a message. git diff shows the differences between two
commits using the 2 commit Ids 

If it is possible to undo changes easily it would make me more
confidant to experiment with a program as I could easily undo the damage
.

I would next like to try Git to try two diffence approaches or braches 
from a commit.
